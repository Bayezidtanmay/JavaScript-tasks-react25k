## I was able to learn and understand many important topics during this course. I am listing them below...

- Variables
- Functions
- Conditions
- Loops
- GitHub configuration
- Document Object Modle (DOM) manipulation
- Arrays and objects
- Constructor

### Besides learning these topics, I learned how to write JS, HTML and CSS correctly by avoiding errors. I learned how to save data in local storage and how to retrieve data from the storage. I also gained knowledge about the API integration through this course.


## Identifying strengths and improvements areas

### After completing the JavaScript course, I can confidently say that I build a solid foundation in JavaScript basics. Now I don't have to face any problems writing any syntax, stuctures and functions. Solving problems is becoming more and more understandable to me every day. Bur I sometimes struggle with more complex asynchronous scenarios, such as handling multiple concurrent API requests. I need to improve in this specific area


## Self-assessment

### Before the course: 2/5 - Before joining the course, I had a basic understanding of JavaScript and I was able to write small scripts like basic variables, numbers and strings.

### After the course: 4/5 - My knowledge has grown significantly after joining the course, especially in understanding advanced JavaScript concepts like functions, loops, objects andf API integrations.

## Challanges and solutions

### Working with loops

- I initially struggled with using loops, especially when dealing with nested loops for iterating through multidimensional arrays and objects. To overcome this, I practiced using different types of loops (for, while, for...of, and for...in) and familiarized myself with array methods like map(), filter(), and reduce(). 


### Working with Callbacks

- I struggling with understanding how callbacks work, especially in asynchronous code. The concept of passing functions as arguments to other functions was confusing at first and I found it hard to manage the structure of code when callbacks were involved. To overcome this problem, I practiced writing small examples where I used callbacks in simpler contexts then I gradually worked my way up to more complex scenarios.
