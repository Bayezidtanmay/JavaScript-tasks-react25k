## Brief summary

The 'Pancake maker' Project is a interactive web application where users can customize their own pancake. It allows customers to select various pancake types, toppings, and extras. Users can also choose the delivery method, which includes options like "Eat In", "Pick Up", and "Delivery." After filling out the order form, users can see the total price, and the order is saved in local storage for later viewing. The project also allows the customer to check out their order details on a separate page. The app provides an outstanding user interface with a clear and straightforward ordering process.


## What worked well and what I am proud of

Real-time price calculation worked very well in this site. The use of event listeners on form inputs ensured that the price was dynamically updated as the user interacted with the form. This makes the experience very interactive and user-friendly. I am proud of how the search and sort functionality works, especially the integration with localStorage.
